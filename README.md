# demofx
The code in this repository demonstrates how to build a JavaFX application. I use the application as a place for testing new facilities. The application is based on the following technologies:

* Java 24
* JsonB
* Server Sent Events (not yet)
* JavaFX 24
* FXML
* OIDC by using Keycloak
* GraalVM
* GraalVM Gradle plugins
* Github workflows and actions

The code reduces the number of external dependencies to make it simpler to native compile the application. The only dependencies are:

* logback and slf4j for logging -- could be replaced with Java logging but I really like these tools
* johnzon-jsonb for handling Json serialization

I would have liked to use CDI, but the CDI implementations seem to be too huge (using millions of third party dependencies making native compilation difficult). In general, I am trying to reduce the number of third party libraries in use like java-built-in httpclient (instead of other libraries). I simply need to be in controll of the source in use. 

## What is demonstrated

* Use of Java, JavaFX, FXML to create a native application
* How to automatically update the application when new versions are released
* Some JavaFx facilities such as panes inside lists
* Use of Java 11 http client and JsonB for backend communication
* Use of OAuth/OIDC for authentication and authorization. Keycloak as OAuth server.
* How to report issues from a client to be backend. An issue reports various information about the native client application such as version information, system properties/environment variables, screenshots, log files, etc.

## To come

* Server Sent Events for pushing events to the native application
* The backend services are implemented in Quarkus (lovely framework). I have not yet published these services but they will be made public.
* Report exceptions back to the backend services.

## Graalvm for Native Client
see https://graalvm.github.io/native-build-tools/latest/gradle-plugin.html

Run this to collect information about classes accessed via reflections and resources needed.  

java -agentlib:native-image-agent=config-output-dir=./agent-data -jar app.jar

```{script}
./gradlew -Pagent run
./gradlew metadataCopy --task run --dir src/main/resources/META-INF/native-image
```

Run this for doing the actual native compilation:

```{script}
./gradlew nativeCompile
build/native/nativeCompile/demofx
```
